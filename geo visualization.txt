Course Objectives : 
In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

1) Work with Folium to create maps.
2) Create and visualize geographical maps in Python.

By the end of this course, you will be able to generate and visualize geographical plots on maps.

Course Structure : 
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
1) Geo-Visualization in Python: This is the hands-on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
2) Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully. 

Project Structure :  

Now we will generate and visualize geographical maps that are useful for data science projects.
We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:

1) Defining Geo-visualization and the Goal of the Project

2) Generating Basic Maps with Folium

3) Generating Stamen Toner and Stamen Terrain Maps

4) Plotting cities in the World Map

5) Geo-Visualization in Real World

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a 
cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. 
This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above-mentioned tasks. 
After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning.
